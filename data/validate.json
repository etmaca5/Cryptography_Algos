sterling & mendell cdp ) at a price of $ 2 . 175 . if\nenron has a separate agreement at these delivery points and can capture a\nmargin difference then that is upside to enron . however , i think the plant\nshould not be charged above the contract price of $ 2 . 285 .\nlooking at the daily gas that was scheduled to the plant for november and\noctober , i did not see that their use went over the contracted volumes from\nwilliams and apache of 45 , 000 mmbtu per day . therefore i don ' t think spot\nprices are part of the equation here . additionally , i recall from our\nmeeting last month that all enron makes on this deal is the agency fee of\n$ . 04 per mmbtu ( excluding the margin difference that enron has on apache gas\ndelivery points if my scenario above is correct ) .\nso based upon items 1 & 2 above , i am suggesting that tenaska iv adjust their\nnovember invoice owed to enron for gas used by the plant by the gas price\ndifferences showed above . therefore , i am planning to wire a payment of\n$ 484 , 234 . 03 ( see breakout below ) on friday , 12 / 22 , to enron on behalf of\ntenaska iv texas partners , ltd . for this activity .\nmonth plant gas price amount\nnovember 267 , 300 2 . 91 $ 777 , 843\nnovember adjustment $ ( 167 , 062 . 50 )\noctober adjustment $ ( 184 , 138 . 99 )\nnov . agency fee 1 , 350 , 000 . 04 $ 54 , 000\nsept . agency fee 98 , 813 . 04 $ 3 , 592 . 52\ntotal $ 484 , 234 . 03\ni discussed these issues with mike mazowita , rick hill & jody pierce before\nreaching this conclusion . should you have any different ideas or thoughts\nthat i am not covering , please call me at 3 -

in mind , i had some thoughts and additional\nquestions for reflection following the meeting that i would like to share .\nyou are in a transition from being a high team performer to becoming the\nleader of a high performing team . one of your frustrations as leader is\nthat members of your team seem to rely too much on you to solve problems\nthat arise in the day to day operations of the team . at first you responded\nto their requests for help by solving it for them , then you shifted to using\nquestioning techniques to have them solve the problem with you . you have\nalso offered some training to address the learnings needed to be more\nindependent problem solvers . you are frustrated when some members of the\nteam continue to come to you with questions they should be able to solve and\nwhen they fail to implement changes that you have trained them to use . you\nare seeking ways for the the team to have the same problem solving ability\nthat they come to you for . you have recruited people with this ability and\nyou seek to expand it in the team .\nthis issue was the focus of our first session and needs to be the focus our\nnext meeting . the question is : how to engage the team in solving this\nproblem . how do i get the members of this team to own this responsibility\nand begin creating their own solutions ? what resources are needed by each\nperson to contribute more to this problem ? how do i involve the team members\nmore in the solving of this problem ? what new behaviors do i need to employ\nto increase the involvement of the team ? what do i need to change in myself\nor my relationship to the people in order to engage them more actively in\nthe problem ?\nthere is one dimension that i am clear about . i know that you have used\nperformance appraisals to give feedback . have you put this issue before the\nteam as a whole for the team to solve or have you tried to change individual\nteam members ?\ni look forward to our meeting on the 17
